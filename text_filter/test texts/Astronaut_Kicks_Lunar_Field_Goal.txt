Explanation:  Score three points for NASA.    With time running out late in Apollo 15's  mission to the Moon in 1971,  Astronaut David Scott prepared to  split the uprights and bring about yet another  dramatic end-of-the-mission victory for NASA.    Scott used a special   lunar football designed for the rugged games held on the  Moon.    R1-D1, a predecessor to  R2-D2,  cheered from the sideline.    Happy April Fools' Day from the folks at  APOD.    In  reality, Astronaut Scott  placed a drill that measured how  temperature changed with lunar depth.   The foreground device actually detected high-energy  particles that escaped from the  Sun.
