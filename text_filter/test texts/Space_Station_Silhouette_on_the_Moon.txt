Explanation:  What's that unusual spot on the Moon?  It's the  International Space Station.  Using precise timing, the  Earth-orbiting space platform  was photographed in front of a partially lit  gibbous Moon last month.  The featured image was taken from  Palo Alto,  California,  USA with an exposure time of only  1/667 of a second.  In contrast, the duration of the transit of the  ISS across the entire Moon was about  half a second.   A close inspection of this unusually  crisp ISS silhouette will reveal the outlines of  numerous solar panels and trusses.   The bright  crater Tycho is visible on the lower left,  as well as comparatively rough,  light colored terrain known as  highlands, and relatively smooth, dark colored areas known as  maria.   On-line  tools can tell you when the  International Space Station will be visible from your area.
